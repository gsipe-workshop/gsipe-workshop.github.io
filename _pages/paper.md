Title: Instability of Trade Gains Reduces Support for Globalization

Abstract: What did the 'winners' of trade liberalization end up getting? Often, it was not as good as they may have hoped. Trade has allowed consumers to acquire goods far more cheaply but at the cost of reliance on foreign supply chains and new risks to standards of living. I argue that the realization of these risks leads voters to update their attitudes towards globalization. I test this hypothesis with exchange-rate driven losses in gains from trade, using fluctuations in the Euro coupled with novel measures of Eurozone regions' differential currency exposure. When a region's realized gains from trade are threatened, that region elects more protectionist and autarkic parties. This potentially explains some of the 'backlash' against globalization and illustrates how the pro-liberalization coalition evolves over time.
