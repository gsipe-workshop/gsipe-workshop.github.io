Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/thai_gsipe_2024.pdf">The Strategic Use of Tariff Phaseouts in US Free Trade Agreements</a>

**Abstract:** What explains the institutional variation within international agreements? While research has largely explored the variation of design elements across international agreements, few have focused on the rich variation within agreement. This paper ad- dresses this gap by examining the varied duration of tariff phaseouts in US free trade agreements (FTAs). While FTAs commit member states to free trade, importing countries retain significant flexibility on the timeline of tariff reduction for specific products. Because tariffs benefit import-competing industries, slower reduction, or longer phasing out of tariffs naturally would preserve the industry and the incumbent Executiveâ€™s political support. I argue that Executives allocate longer tariff phaseouts for industries concentrated in electorally competitive constituencies to protect their electoral prospects. I test my argument using a novel dataset on product-level tariff treatment in FTAs and find industries concentrated in swing and core states receive longer phaseouts. However, I find that President George W. Bush allocated longer phaseouts during his second term rather than the first, contradicting conventional views. These findings have important implications for understanding how FTAs have been able to proliferate despite inherent domestic challenges.
