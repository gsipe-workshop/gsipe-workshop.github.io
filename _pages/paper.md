Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/liptrot_gsipe_2024.pdf">**Personalist Property: When do Autocratic Successions Cause FDI Expropriation? **</a>

**Abstract:**

While the impact of democratic constraints on property rights has been extensively studied, the effect of constraints on autocrats remains under-explored. Our research shows that unlike democratic constraints on leaders, leader personalism in autocracies does not increase the likelihood of expropriation of FDI. However, by using plausibly exogenous changes in leadership caused by leaders’ terminal illnesses and accidents, we find that the risk of expropriation increases during leadership transitions only in regimes where the outgoing leader is personalist. Our results suggest that the effect of leadership transitions is contingent on the degree of constraints imposed on the departing leader (measured by the predecessor’s personalism). Our results are robust to controlling for various factors such as democracy, regime type, ideology, and natural resource rents.
