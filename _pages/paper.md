Title: Beyond Foreign Aid: How do Developing Countries Substitute Concessional Financing?

Abstract: Developing countries have traditionally relied on concessional aid from donors to support government budgets. However, few can sustain this reliance indefinitely and will eventually shift towards other sources of revenue. This shift raises critical questions: How do countries replace aid-based financing? What determines their choice of substitutes? We develop a theoretical framework that evaluates the comparative advantages of internal and external revenue substitutes for governments transitioning away from aid-based financing. Leveraging an instrumental variable (IV) approach and the exogenous shock of crossing International Development Association (IDA)’s operational lending threshold, we examine how developing country governments adapt to the loss of aid and the effects of various substitutes—ranging from taxation to private bond markets to Chinese loans—on fiscal sustainability and governance outcomes. We demonstrate empirical evidence that governments in the developing context turn towards the bond market when experiencing loss in aid revenues. We argue that the choice of substitutes is shaped by both international and domestic factors such as global liquidity conditions and domestic political competition.
