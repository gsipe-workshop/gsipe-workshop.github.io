Title: BIT by BIT: How Bilateral Investment Treaty Network Shapes Foreign Direct Investment

**Abstract:** Do bilateral investment treaties (BITs) have broader effects beyond the signatory states? We posit that the network formed by the collection of BITs transmits information about countries’ domestic investment environment, such as the quality of their legal institutions, to other states within the network, which shapes the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and facilitates new treaty negotiations. To test this claim, we compile a comprehensive dataset of dyadic investment flows between states from 1970-2012. Using an event study design, we find that when two states become indirectly linked via BITs through an intermediate state, the FDI flow between the pair increases 50% faster on average in the next twenty years relative to the unconnected state dyads. Additionally, the country pair become 16% more likely to form a new BIT between them. To examine whether the information transmission mechanism facilitates this process, we further investigate heterogeneous treatment effects based on the quality of domestic legal institutions. As countries’ rule of law increases, treatment effects increase for FDI flows, and decrease for BIT formation. Our findings highlight network spillover as a substantial component of the overall effect of BITs: For state within the BIT network, ratifying investment treaties not only strengthens economic ties with its new partner, but it helps transmit information to many others.
