Title: Loaded Questions: Global Liquidity and the Legislative Agenda in Zambia

Abstract: How do local politicians react to changing global economic conditions? Literature on policymaking in developing countries typically highlights countries' dependent positions in the global economy or focuses exclusively on domestic political dynamics. In this paper, I explore how politicians in Zambia respond to their entry into global markets. From 2011 onwards, Zambia funded infrastructure spending by borrowing heavily from international markets and bilateral creditors. However, the content of spending demands from local members of parliament (MPs) varies significantly, with some pressing for local infrastructure investment while others pursue shared national investment in health and education. Using a new dataset of 9,362 parliamentary questions and multinomial regression for categorical variables, I show that MPs shift their attention toward infrastructure when global interest rates drop and when they have electoral leverage over the party. I then use random forests to test the interactive effects of these variables. I show that MPs are sensitive to both local and global constraints on fiscal policy choices. This paper demonstrates that MPs in developing countries act strategically when choosing which issues to foreground in the public agenda.
