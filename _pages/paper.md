Title: Supply Chains and Political Strategies: Analyzing Firm Responses to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

Abstract: This paper examines how firms’ supply chain relationships influence their political stances toward carbon tariffs, specifically the EU’s newly implemented Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). I argue that firms sourcing from suppliers in states with advanced carbon emission regulations are more likely to support CBAM, as they can benefit from exemptions or reduced tariffs while imposing additional costs on competitors relying on suppliers from states with limited carbon regulations. Conversely, firms with suppliers from states with few regulations are more likely to oppose CBAM due to increased import costs. Using firm-level supply chain data and political activity records from the EU Transparency Register, I empirically analyze whether reliance on suppliers from states with different levels of emission regulatory stringency shapes EU-based firms’ support or opposition to CBAM and related legislation. Text analysis techniques are also applied to firms’ submitted documents during the EU’s public consultation to determine their stances.
