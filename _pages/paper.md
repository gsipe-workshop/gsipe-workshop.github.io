Title: Pressure Breeds Innovation: How Firms Adapt to Export Control Sanctions

Abstract: This article examines whether firms listed on the U.S. Entity List increase in-house technology development in response to export control sanctions, and under what conditions this response is more likely. I argue that targeted firms are more likely to invest in internal R&D when they are highly dependent on U.S. technology, face strict license review policies, expect sanctions to last for a long time, and have strong financial resources or existing innovation capacity. Using a panel of 97 publicly traded sanctioned firms and 367 matched peer firms from 2003 to 2023, I apply a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design with firm-fixed effects and cluster-robust standard errors. Innovation is measured by R&D spending, R&D personnel, and the number of applied and granted patents. The empirical results partially support the theory. The findings show that targeted sanctions can unintentionally promote technological self-sufficiency and innovation. This study contributes to the sanctions literature by identifying the policy features and firm characteristics that shape different innovation responses.
