Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/li_gsipe_2024.pdf"> Africa? US? Or China? The Impact of Policy Framing on Public Support Toward a Closer US-African Engagement</a>

**Abstract:** Despite bipartisan consensus on intensifying the United States’ involvement with Africa, there is a dearth of academic research addressing the public’s support for such engagement. Moreover, while policymakers and politicians emphasize the objective of countering China (China-centric) when articulating the US’s strategy toward Africa, the US also simultaneously purports to promote a more prosperous Africa (Africa-centric) and expand its influence on the continent (US-centric). This study employs a novel survey experiment to determine which framing most effectively elicits public support. The finding suggests that the US-centric framing, compared with other framings, decreases public support, and China-centric and Africa-centric framings cannot increase people’s support further. The framing effect is based on the framing itself instead of traveling through other mediators, such as people’s beliefs about the threat of China. Party identity is crucial in assessing the support level, as the Democrats are always more likely to support closer African-US engagement. Still, the US-centric framing effect is more pronounced among Republicans. These partisan differences suggest that the national-level bipartisan consensus on this issue does not capture the complexity at the individual level. This research highlights an additional avenue for examining the US-China and the US-Africa bilateral relations, and it reveals how these relationships shape public support for foreign policies where all three countries have considerable strategic and economic interests.
