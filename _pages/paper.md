Title: Cashless vs Cash Only: The Political Economy of Digital Payments

Abstract: Technology in finance is not a new phenomenon. This paper focuses on digital payments as a type of financial technology. Digital/electronic payments refer to the transfer of value from one payment account to another using a digital device/channel. While modes of payments have evolved over time driven by convenience and ease of exchange, from bartering to electronic payments, significant variation remains across countries in digital payments versus cash usage. Countries with the highest levels of cash in circulation to GDP globally include a mix of countries with different technology readiness, levels of economic development, and financial sector development such as Japan, Germany, and Morocco. Similarly, countries with the lowest cash intensity to GDP include Norway, Botswana, and Nigeria. What explains this cross-country variation in electronic payments usage? Due to limited historical data on digital payments, this study approaches the question by examining physical cash in circulation (CIC) to GDP ratios, which is negatively correlated with electronic payments' usage. I use an unbalanced panel data analysis with robust clustered standard errors for 167 countries from 2001 to 2022. This study is essential as digital payment systems are becoming a pillar of modern finance yielding significant political power to actors who leverage them for improved tax collection, benefits' distribution, and fighting corruption.
