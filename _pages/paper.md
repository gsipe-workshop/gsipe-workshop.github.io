Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/guerrero_trinidad_gsipe_2024.pdf"> Non-State Social Structures and Social Capital: Evidence on Crime and Conflict</a>

**Abstract:** Across the world, weak state capacity has led to the formation of nonstate security arrangements. But do these nonstate social structures, particularly bottom-up ones, impact long-term individual development trajectories and behavior? This paper explores the peasant rounds formed between 1976 and 1982 in Peru. Using variation in exposure to rounds at different ages and districts of birth, I find that childhood exposure to rounds decreases future criminal activity in 14% and conflict-related crimes in 32%. It prevents the expansion of armed nonstate groups, and the violence associated with them. I use a significant weather shock to explore the potential mechanisms. The effects persist even when individuals migrate to high crime areas or districts with lower state capacity, indicating influences beyond economic shocks, safety, or state capacity. Peasant rounds seem to foster lasting social capital, reinforcing both community bonds and broader social networks. I find persistent effects, including spillover and intergenerational effects in migrant-hosting districts. These findings highlight the power of bottom-up groups to strengthen social bonds and complement state capacity and bring insights into the understanding of institutional resilience and the lasting role of early life experiences in shaping individual trajectories.
