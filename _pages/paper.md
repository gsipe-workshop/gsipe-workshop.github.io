Title: Progressive versus Competitive Democracy: Examining the Political Determinants of Universal Healthcare Reform in the Global South

Abstract: The achievement of universal health coverage (UHC) for all stands at the centre of the international development agenda, championed by both national governments and transnational organisations. Despite this global consensus, national implementation varies widely across the world, emphasising that processes of healthcare reform remain inherently political rather than technocratic. While the literature has consistently highlighted the central role of regime type and especially democratisation, it remains poorly understood which specific attributes of democracy are conducive to achieving truly universal healthcare systems. This paper examines the political determinants of universal healthcare reform by investigating two prominent drivers of policy expansion in the Global South – government partisanship and electoral competition – and their interaction with two mediating factors of interest-based politics: insider-outsider politics and international development assistance. The paper codes the timing of major healthcare reforms across a sample of 90 countries in the Global South between 1990 and 2023, classifying them as either universal or segmenting. Drawing further on data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and Development Assistance for Health databases, the analysis employs an event history analysis to investigate the factors associated with each type of reform. The findings demonstrate that politics plays a critical role in healthcare reform, even outweighing socio-economic factors. However, neither of the main explanatory factors – party ideology or electoral competition – is systematically associated with policy reform in the Global South. Instead, the study provides a more nuanced perspective on the complexities of political processes, showing that it is the combination of several factors – such as left-wing governments facing weak trade unions, right-wing governments receiving development assistance, or high electoral pressures supported by organised labour – that significantly increases the likelihood of universal reform.
