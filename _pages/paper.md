Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/scholten_gsipe_2024.pdf">The Prodigal Child Returns? Attitudes Towards Return Migration in a Developing Economy</a>

**Abstract:**
Data estimates suggest that up to half of all migrants return to the country within 5 years of leaving. Return migration is known to be a boon for the local economy and a catalyst for political reform. However, these effects are conditional on successful reintegration, which is dependent on the preferences of non-migrants. What causes negative attitudes towards return migration, given its significant potential economic benefits? I argue that non-migrants are concerned about both the economic and political competition of returnees. Non-migrants prefer to welcome back migrants who can bring back home financial capital and employment, but will oppose competitors on the job market when unemployment is high. Furthermore, non-migrants are concerned about the potential role of return migrants as norm entrepreneurs. I test my hypotheses with a conjoint survey experiment conducted in Colombia, as well as an analysis of the 2016 peace referendum.
