  <div class="paper-title"> The Political Economy of Concessional Climate Finance: Evidence from the GCF and CIF </div>

  <div class="paper-abstract">
   Climate finance is essential for supporting mitigation and adaptation in developing economies, 6 yet current flows fall short of the annual investment needs. Multilateral climate funds (MCFs) like 7 the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Climate Investment Funds (CIF) play pivotal roles in providing 8 and mobilizing concessional climate finance, but empirical insights into drivers of their 9 concessionality design and financial allocations remain limited. This paper combines project 10 portfolio data, policy documents, participant observation, and 25 stakeholder interviews to 11 investigate factors influencing concessionality and finance deployment by GCF and CIF. Our 12 findings reveal distinct concessionality approaches in the two MCFs use influenced by six 13 determining and moderating factors including institutional design, project characteristics, recipient 14 country characteristics, and multilateral climate politics. We discuss insights to inform how MCFs 15 can better balance equity, effectiveness, and private capital mobilization. Understanding these 16 dynamics is critical for enhancing the multilateral climate finance architecture to support climate 17 action in developing countries.

  <div class="paper-title"> Democracy and Financial Disintermediation: A Conjoint Experiment in Peru </div>
  <div class="paper-author"> Ghita Chraibi </div>
  <div class="paper-university">University of Virginia</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
   Financial technologies (fintech) promise to democratize finance through cheaper, faster services, facilitating financial inclusion by resolving supply constraints. Then, why hasn't fintech solved financial inclusion in Peru, one of Latin America's least banked countries? This study builds on work revealing that payment choices reflect political preferences rather than economic efficiency alone, and that autocratic governance increases citizens' "exit" from formal financial systems. I term this "exit" financial disintermediation, distinguishing between intermediated fintech (mobile money) relying on trusted third parties and disintermediated alternatives (Bitcoin, cash) operating without central authorities while protecting anonymity. When citizens bypass banks and reject intermediated fintech, as in Peru, this reveals preferences for disintermediated finance. I argue cash remains Peru's primary payment method despite government fintech encouragement because cash's preferred attributes in contexts of eroding institutional trust (untraceable, immediate, final, requiring no inter-party trust) don't transfer to mobile money. Where financial disintermediation is likely due to trust erosion and democratic backsliding, individuals prefer fintech with cash-like attributes (Bitcoin). I test this through a conjoint experiment in Peru randomizing fintech payment attributes, providing micro-level evidence of how payment attributes impact financial behavior during democratic backsliding.

  <div class="paper-title"> Deferring Punishment from Liberalizing Trade: The Effects of Tariff Phaseouts in NAFTA </div>
  <div class="paper-author"> Eric Thai </div>
  <div class="paper-university">UC San Diego</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
   Can international trade agreements be designed to delay political fallout? I argue that phasing out tariffs can delay and mitigate the political consequences of trade liberalization. I test these hypotheses using the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States’ first and most consequential regional trade pact. First, I establish that longer phaseouts led to longer delays in employment decline for import-sensitive industries. Second, I find that counties sensitive to imports with minimal tariff phaseout punished Democratic presidential candidates immediately. In contrast, areas with more phaseout coverage penalize them later once tariffs are completely phased out. Third, Democratic Representatives and Senators who supported NAFTA are at greater risk of being voted out of office; however, greater phaseout coverage for their district mitigates such risk entirely. This article presents new evidence suggesting that highly particularistic provisions of trade agreements can delay and mitigate electoral backlash.

  <div class="paper-title"> From Gender Rhetoric to Lending Rules: Enforcing Equality in Multilateral Development Bank Lending </div>
  <div class="paper-author"> Natalie Playford </div>
  <div class="paper-university">University of Toronto</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
   How and when do Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) transform gender-equality rhetoric into enforceable lending conditions? Despite heightened global commitments, gender clauses, such as Gender Action Plans and gender-responsive budgeting, remain unevenly embedded in loan agreements. This paper provides the first systematic, cross-bank analysis of gender clause adoption across 4,906 World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank loans (2000-2025). Drawing on supervised machine-learning text classification and manual coding, it develops a measure of clause strength and tests three mechanisms: reputational pressure, sectoral repertoires, and bureaucratic routinization. Ordered-probit and event-study models demonstrate that global normative triggers, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) reporting cycles and the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), significantly increase the likelihood of substantive clauses, while internal strategy rollouts often yield symbolic rather than enforceable provisions. Social-sector lending predicts stronger clauses, but the most powerful predictor is reference to institutionalized gender-screening and monitoring processes, which increases the probability of binding language by over 20%. These findings show that gender mainstreaming in MDBs operates as a reputational equilibrium, where external scrutiny catalyzes adoption, but only durable internal procedures convert norms into enforceable commitments.

  <div class="paper-title"> To Invest or Not to Invest: Geoeconomic Closeness & Strategic Sector Investments </div>
  <div class="paper-author"> Rudra M Guha Bisas </div>
  <div class="paper-university">University of California, Riverside</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
   How does the increasing tensions between the US and China affect inward investments to the US? Geoeconomics, or the strategic use of economic instruments for geopolitical outcomes, increasingly shapes global investment and trade flows, and has raised fears of a geoeconomic fragmentation, as firms adjust their internationalization strategies based on emerging global political realities. This study suggests that instead of a geoeconomic fragmentation, the world is witnessing a geoeconomic re-alignment, with investments flowing based on the political closeness. I use incoming foreign direct investment (FDI) to the US to argue that strategic sector firms from countries closely aligned to China are reducing investments into the US due to fears of adverse policy actions, i.e., a weaponization of interdependence. Leveraging the semi-conductor sales ban to Chinese firms implemented by the US in 2022 as an identification mechanism, I use a difference-in-difference (DiD) as well as a Synthetic Control DiD design to analyze global FDI inflows to the US from 2014 thru 2023, utilizing country-wise sector-year data from fDiMarkets. I find strong evidence that countries closer to China reduced their strategic sector FDI to the US after the geoeconomic shock in 2022. These findings provide evidence for a geoeconomic re-alignment of international investments. Along with providing a causal evidence for this phenomenon, this research provides key insights into the sectoral preferences of firms in this newly emergent world order.

  <div class="paper-title">Beyond Pro- and Anti-Trade: A Two Dimensional Framework of Trade Preferences </div>
  <div class="paper-author">Yujin Zhang (Columbia University)  & Gary Ziwen Zu (UC San Diego) </div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    Public attitudes toward international trade have long been analyzed as unidimensional, with individuals’ preferences placed on a spectrum ranging from opposition to support. This framework, however, struggles to conceptualize trade positions with opposite views on imports and exports, as well as masks different rationales driving the same policy positions. This study proposes a two-dimensional perspective. Based on their attitudes toward imports and exports and the relationship between the two, we categorize individuals into four trade groups. Drawing on original surveys conducted in the United States and China, we find significant profile differences between these groups in terms of their economic, ideological, and out-group preferences, suggesting distinct rationales in forming their trade attitudes. Relying on embedded vignette and conjoint experiments, we causally document that groups with similar attitudes toward imports or exports react substantially differently to the same frames of trade balance and vary in their support for trade policies. Together, our findings establish a novel framework for understanding trade preferences in future research and the public support for trade policies in
the world’s two largest economies.

  <div class="paper-title">Who Contests? How Outside Options Shape Contestation in Global Financial Governance </div>
  <div class="paper-author">Greg Brownstein</div>
  <div class="paper-university">George Washington University</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    How have new sovereign creditors impacted contestation in global financial governance? Since the 1990s, the number of creditors available to sovereign borrowers has expanded. Conventional wisdom suggests that new creditors constitute an "outside option" for debtor states. Scholars have found that states leverage outside options to push back on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during loan program negotiations. But the literature has not fully considered how different types of outside options impact contestation differently. Nor have scholars explored this relationship within the context of economic surveillance. I hypothesize that outside options exhibit variation with regards to their credibility. Credibility options enable contestation while others do not. To test this argument, I compile a novel dataset of 1900 IMF Executive Board statements from 1992 to 2022 in which country representatives share their views on IMF surveillance findings. I develop a bespoke text analysis model to measure the level of contestation in each of the statements. Using fixed effects linear regression models, I find statistically significant evidence that an increase in Chinese finance is correlated with an increase in contestation while an increase in private finance is correlated with a decrease in contestation. These findings suggest that the ongoing fragmentation of global governance will have mixed effects on patterns of contestation.

  <div class="paper-university">The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    Why do white and minority Americans appear to react differently to the same trade shocks? I argue that what looks like identity-based divergence is largely the product of racialized labor markets: groups face different exposure to import competition and unequal access to recovery pathways. Using commuting-zone, race-specific measures of the China trade shock and service-sector reallocation, and estimating group-specific causal effects with a double machine learning IV design, I show that (i) among white respondants, higher trade exposure reduced support for the Democratic candidate in 2016, but this effect was buffered where lower-value (non-professional) services expanded; (ii) among Black respondents, baseline trade effects are small, but growth in professional services modestly sustains Democratic support; and (iii) estimates for Hispanic respondents are mixed and imprecise. Additional evidence favors a sociotropic mechanism - changes in perceptions of national well-being and opportunity - over individual income losses. The results recast the "trade backlash" as a consequence of how shocks and recovery are distributed across racialized labor markets, and they clarify why prior interaction-based models confounded identification.

  <div class="paper-title">Distributive Politics and Energy Transitions: Household Stratified Adaption to Fuel Subsidy Reform in Nigeria</div>
  <div class="paper-author">Fikayo Akeredolu</div>
  <div class="paper-university">University of Oxford</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    How do unequal capacities for adaption shape the distribution consequences and political legitimacy of welfare reform in weak-capacity, oil-producing states? This paper examines Nigeria's 2023 fuel subsidy removal, a policy justified on fiscal grounds but implemented amid widespread energy poverty. Using two waves of the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study, Afrobarometer survey data, and 250 household interviews, I find that the subsidy removal produced more regressive outcomes than the policy it replaced. The reform drove petrol prices from N200 to N1,250 per liter, making solar energy cost-competitive but requiring prohibitive upfront capital of N2 million or more. Wealthier households adopted solar at substantially higher rates and partially escaped energy poverty. Poorer households curtailed energy consumption entirely, experiencing welfare losses without compensating gains. I theorize this as stratified adaptation, a process through which pre-existing inequalities in financial resources and infrastructure access determine both material and political effects of reform. This material stratification translated directly into legitimacy erosion: citizens unable to adapt interpreted the reform as state abandonment and systematically withdrew support from government institutions. Because adaptive capacity follows existing wealth hierarchies, subsidy removal reproduced inequality in both material outcomes and political trust, illustrating how reform outcomes are conditioned by prior distributions of advantage.

  <div class="paper-abstract">
    Market interventions are a frequent lever for governments to ease the costs of economic transformations. Green industrial policy (GIP) is a recent example of such policy, seeking to ease the costs of the ecological transition. It is an open question, however, if governments benefit from the provision of GIP. My central claim is that rather than GIP being a tool against climate change alone, it is better considered as one against deindustrialization. This broader conceptualization provides insights into the spatial variation of GIP's electoral consequences: GIP is more likely to win the incumbent votes in places with increased risk and exposure to deindustrialization, namely along the dimensions of globalization and decarbonization. Hence in communities doubly-pressured by both dimensions, GIP implementation is an effective tool to win back voters "left-behind" and at risk of further economic precarity. I test this argument using geo-located data from the Inflation Reduction Act, leveraging variation in investment status in November 2024 for identification in a difference-in-differences framework. The absence of general electoral impact masks substantial heterogeneity: doubly-pressured communities shifted 2-3 p.p. towards the Democrats after receiving investment. I complement these national level results with a case study of Michigan. Fine grained voting data, planning documents, candidate statements, and local news coverage corroborate the differential response to GIP in these doubly-pressured areas, but not elsewhere.

    How do electorates react to trade liberalization? I argue that liberalization offers domestic producers access to new, cheaper, and better inputs. This in turn increases real incomes, leading to electoral rewards. I test this hypothesis in the context of the 1991 trade reforms imposed by the IMF on India, which I argue constitute a natural experiment to determine the effects of tariff reduction. I create novel measures of region-specific exposure to tariff changes and use a difference-in-difference design to find that greater access to better inputs is spatially associated with greater support for the pro-reform incumbent.

  <div class="paper-abstract">
    After the Bretton Woods, the US Financial hegemony has shown a complex evolution rooted in structural power and market power, and is undergoing a brand-new digital-fintech-driven evolution. The paper innovatively integrates reduced-form regressions and Bayesian structural vector autoregressions to identify potential transformative digital forces that could affect the international monetary order and the US financial hegemony. The empirical results indicate that US-dollar-backed Bitcoin is promisingly possible to exert a significant positive effect on the dollar index DXY in the near future, as most Markov Chain Monte Carlo draws of the 95% credible interval of the impulse response are positive. It further accredits the main long-term driving factor on Bitcoin to stablecoin supply at the 95% credible level and then jointly reveals the logic that the self-reinforcement cycle from dollar to stablecoin to Bitcoin finally back to dollar is playing a role in bolstering the global dominance of the dollar in the international monetary order.

  <div class="paper-author">Jerik Cruz</div>
  <div class="paper-university">MIT</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    A long political economy tradition argues that centralized states deploying concerted industrial policies are crucial for developing productive industries. Yet developing countries that have emerged as major exporters of knowledge-based services (e.g. software/ R&D / AI services) have often lacked these state structures. I advance a new theory of how the rise of these services-exporting hubs have driven by skilled migrant networks engaging with porous and dispersed bureaucracies. These structures foster bureaucrats' connectedness to peripheral entrepreneurial networks, allowing policymakers to leverage distributed tacit knowledge held by migrant co-nationals in processes of fine-grained collaboration. I test this argument using first-ever, agency-level datasets of industrial policy bureaucracies covering all GATT/WTO members since 1989, and historical process-tracing of the Phillipines' and Malaysia's diverging knowledge economy transitions based on 50 elite interviews. My results challenge a vast literature underscoring "Weberian" bureaucracies and autonomous "developmental states" as prerequisites for structural transformation in the era of knowledge-based capitalism.

  <div class="paper-title">Money Talks: Using Cash and Bitcoin to Unpack The Politics of Financial Disintermediation</div>
  <div class="paper-author">Ghita Chraibi</div>
  <div class="paper-university">University of Virginia</div>
  <div class="abstract-label">Abstract:</div>
  <div class="paper-abstract">
    When do people choose formal financial services and when do they instead exit `a la Hirschman (1970) using cash or Bitcoin? Despite financial technologies' (fintech) growth, citizens are still bypassing traditional institutions: cash remains sticky worldwide and Bitcoin adoption is increasing. I refer to this phenomenon as financial disintermediation, distinguishing between intermediated fintech (mobile banking) that relies on trusted third parties and disintermediated alternatives (peer-topeer Bitcoin, cash) that operate without central authorities and protect anonymity. Extending Hirschman's "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty" framework to finance, I argue that payment choices reflect political preferences rather than economic efficiency alone. My research reveals that autocratic governance increases citizens' "exit" from formal financial systems. Citizens in these contexts either distrust institutions or fear them, resulting in exit through disintermediated alternatives. I test this theory using cash dependency (167 countries, 2001-2020) and Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions (143 countries, 2020). My findings confirm that financial disintermediation is systematically prevalent in autocratic contexts. This work contributes by bringing individual agency back into financial intermediation debates, extending Hirschman's framework to finance, and providing the first systematic evidence linking autocratic governance to payment preferences.
