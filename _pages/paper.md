Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/park_gsipe_2024.pdf">Green Protectionism in the Eyes of the Beholder</a>

**Abstract:** Can protectionism increase public support for climate change policies? Many national governments, including the US, are introducing climate policies that favor domestic producers in their pursuit of mitigating climate change. While proponents argue that protectionist measures on climate policies help garner political support for climate legislation, this claim has not been empirically tested. Using a survey experiment, I examine which aspect of protectionism can increase public support for climate change policy. I compare various frames (i.e. economic and security frames) and party cues used to promote protectionist climate policies and examine heterogeneous effects by oneâ€™s prior nationalistic values and environmental concerns. I find that neither an economic frame nor a security frame increases the overall support for the climate policy. In particular, those with a high level of environmental concern decrease their overall support for the policy when they see that the climate policy is protectionist, regardless of the frame or the party cue. In short, my results imply that emphasizing non-environmental aspects of a climate policy can backfire, decreasing support for the policy among those who would otherwise be the strongest supporters of a climate policy.
