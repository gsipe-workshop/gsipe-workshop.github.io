Title:  How Foreign Direct Investment Affects Support for Defense Commitments

Abstract: This study examines how public perceptions of foreign direct investment (FDI) shape support for defense commitments. It argues that perceptions of national interests and their strategic importance can increase public willingness to defend an ally in the event of conflict. Using a conjoint experiment, this research evaluates how perceived economic benefits from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and the strategic importance of Taiwan influence public support for defending Taiwan. The findings reveal that public backing for defense commitments is significantly stronger when economic and strategic interests are 
perceived as vital to national security. This study advances our understanding of how economic interdependence informs public opinion on foreign policy, particularly in the context of high-risk security challenges.
