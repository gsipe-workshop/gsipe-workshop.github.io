## About GSIPE

The Graduate Student International Political Economy Workshop (GSIPE) is a **virtual, interdisciplinary, graduate-student-run workshop** that creates a supportive environment for emerging scholars in the field.

### Our Mission
We provide a dedicated venue for graduate students, pre-docs, and post-docs to:
- Present works-in-progress
- Receive constructive feedback from peers and faculty
- Build connections within the IPE community

### Who We Serve
We welcome graduate students and faculty from **Political Science** and **Economics** with interests in International Political Economy ([broadly defined](https://www.isanet.org/ISA/Sections/IPE)). 

**All stages of research are welcome** — from early-stage projects to job market papers.
